# Transaction-Management-System

## overview
Transaction Management system is a Java project that maintains all user transaction records in the commercial and banking sectors. It is easy to understand and handle. Here the major part is controlled by the user who have already an account of this system. The user can also delete the account of an individual. The main objective of this project is that a user who has already registered can send or receive money & can track spending metrics by using this application & if a person spends money offline by using cash the person can maintain a small transaction record.

## Workflow
1. First, we are able to see the “Login Page” where a person can login into his/her user account, if he/she have the username and password. Otherwise, he/she can choose the “Register” option from the below to create a new account or register himself/herself.
